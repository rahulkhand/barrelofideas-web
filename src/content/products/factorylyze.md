One of the most challenging sections of the generation 4 video games is the [Battle Factory](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Factory_(Generation_IV)). Consistently winning battles against randomized opponent teams without a single loss means every move counts. With the Factorylyze app for iOS, there is more visibility into the exact opponent sets by simply entering known fields such as moves seen or held item used. Plus the searching power is readily available from your pocket which means no need to surf the web or sift through massive spreadsheets.

Why is any analysis even needed?
- To get a gold print (the highest award) in the Platinum/HG/SS Battle Factory, the player must win 49 consecutive 3 vs. 3 battles. 
    - One loss at any point means you start all over. 
    - Your choice and the opponents choice of the team largely comes down to chance so the cards are highly stacked against you to eventually face unfavorable opponents.
- In the Open Level category of the Gen IV Battle Factory, there are 150 possible foes to face off.
    - Each foe can be any 1 of 4 unique sets (different moves/items/abilities/stats). 
    - With so many possibilities it can be hard to identify what the opponent might have.

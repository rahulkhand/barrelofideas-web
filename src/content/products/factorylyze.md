Factorylyze provides a way to quickly analyze the state of a battle in the battle factory. In generation 4 open level, there are 150 possible pokémon to face off each with 4 unique sets. With so many possibilities it can be hard to identify what the opponent might have. Doing a search online and sifting through all the possibilities is a valid yet cumbersome way to solve the problem. With Factorylyze, you can do this filtering analysis with a quick localized search on predefined fields geared towards identification. No more ctrl/cmd + f searches through never ending lists. Search on any combination of name, item, moves, or set number. Only true results will be shown and all other variants will be hidden from sight. 

Why is any analysis even needed? Isn't Pokémon a children's game? \
To get a gold print (the highest award) in this post game area, the player must win 49 consecutive 3 vs. 3 battles. One loss at any point means you start all over. Since your choice and the opponents choice of the team largely comes down to chance, the cards are highly stacked against you to eventually face unfavorable opponents. For this reason it is imperative to play with as much information that is available when navigating the uncertainty.
